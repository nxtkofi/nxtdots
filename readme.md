# Introduction
Custom Linux rice and configuration files, optimized for speed, minimalism, and style.  
Originally inspired by [ml4w's dotfiles](https://github.com/ml4w), but heavily modified - you'd never guess the origin now.

---

## ✨ Highlights

- ✅ Waybar based on **Mechabar**, heavily customized
- 🎨 Dynamic pywal-based theming
- ⚡ Wallpaper switcher rewritten in **Go** — up to **17× faster**
- 🧼 Cleanup of unused variables, consistent formatting
- 🔀 Custom theme switcher
- 🧪 Benchmarks comparing Shell vs Go

---

## Quickstart
```sh
git clone https://github.com/nxtkofi/nxtdots ~/.config/
cd .config
chmod +x ./install.sh
mkdir -p ~/.cache/wallpaper
./install.sh
```
Make sure to visit [configuration section](#configuration) and download the
necessary [requirements](#requirements)

---

## Requirements

Packages:
- fzf
- waybar 0.13.0 (0.14.0 has an issue rendering some things)
- vesktop (vencord, walcord)
- spicetify-cli
- python-pywal16
- magick

--- 

## 🧠 Background

This config started as a fork of ml4w’s dotfiles — I borrowed a lot of basics to get started.  
Since then, the setup evolved significantly:

- Removed redundant scripts and variables
- Created a **pywal-integrated theming system** for Waybar
- Customized Waybar’s style and logic
- Added **dynamic theme switching** with a script

> Today, it’s a completely independent and streamlined setup tailored for performance and aesthetic.

## 🚀 Why I Migrated Scripts to Go (and how I sped them up by ~94.2%)

At some point I decided to rewrite core scripts in **Go**, primarily out of curiosity and for the challenge.  
But the performance gains were a huge bonus.

### 💥 Final Results

The main script (wallpaper changer):

| Method     | Speed Gain |
|------------|------------|
| `go run`   | ~15.5×     |
| Binary     | ~17×       |

And it's still clean, readable, and scalable for future additions.

### Edited .desktop files

For floating pacseek (windowrule is already configured in
~/.config/hypr/conf/windowrule.conf) You have to edit org.moson.pacseek.desktop
file that's located in /usr/share/applications directory like so:
- pacseek
```.config
[Desktop Entry]

Name=pacseek
Comment=A terminal user interface for searching and installing Arch Linux packages

Icon=pacseek

Terminal=false
```

- vesktop
```
[Desktop Entry]

Categories=Network;
Keywords=discord;vencord;electron;chat;
Comment=Vesktop is a custom Discord App aiming to give you better performance and improve linux support. Vencord comes pre-installed
MimeType=x-scheme-handler/discord
```

- spotify
```
[Desktop Entry]
