# Introduction
Custom Linux rice and configuration files, optimized for speed, minimalism, and style.  
Originally inspired by [ml4w's dotfiles](https://github.com/ml4w), but heavily modified - you'd never guess the origin now.

---

## ‚ú® Highlights

- ‚úÖ Waybar based on **Mechabar**, heavily modified
- üé® Dynamic pywal-based theming
- ‚ö° Wallpaper switcher rewritten in **Go** ‚Äî up to **17√ó faster**
- üßº Cleanup of unused variables, consistent formatting
- üîÄ Custom theme switcher
- üß™ Benchmarks comparing Shell vs Go

---

## Quickstart
```sh
git clone https://github.com/nxtkofi/nxtdots ~/.config/
cd .config/scripts
chmod +x ./bin/main
./install.sh
```
Make sure to visit [configuration section](#configuration) and download the
necessary [requirements](#requirements)

---

## Requirements

Packages:
- fzf
- waybar 0.13.0 (0.14.0 has an issue rendering some things)
- vesktop 
- walcord
- spicetify-cli
- python-pywal16
- magick
- nmtui
- bluetuith
- power-profiles-daemon

--- 

## üß† Background

This config started as a fork of ml4w‚Äôs dotfiles ‚Äî I borrowed a lot of basics to get started.  
Since then, the setup evolved significantly:

- Removed redundant scripts and variables
- Created a **pywal-integrated theming system** for Waybar
- Customized Waybar‚Äôs style and logic
- Added **dynamic theme switching** with a script

> Today, it‚Äôs a completely independent and streamlined setup tailored for performance and aesthetic.

## üöÄ Why I Migrated Scripts to Go (and how I sped them up by ~94.2%)

At some point I decided to rewrite core scripts in **Go**, primarily out of curiosity and for the challenge.  
But the performance gains were a huge bonus.

### üí• Final Results

The main script (wallpaper changer):

| Method     | Speed Gain |
|------------|------------|
| `go run`   | ~15.5√ó     |
| Binary     | ~17√ó       |

And it's still clean, readable, and scalable for future additions.

### Edited .desktop files

For floating pacseek (windowrule is already configured in
~/.config/hypr/conf/windowrule.conf) You have to edit org.moson.pacseek.desktop
file that's located in /usr/share/applications directory like so:
- pacseek
```.config
[Desktop Entry]

Name=pacseek
Comment=A terminal user interface for searching and installing Arch Linux packages

Icon=pacseek
Type=Application
Categories=Utility;
Keywords=terminal;package;

Exec=kitty --class Pacseek pacseek
StartupNotify=false
Terminal=false
```

- vesktop
```
[Desktop Entry]
Name=Vesktop

Terminal=false
Type=Application
Icon=/home/<your-profile>/.config/assets/discord_custom.png
StartupWMClass=vesktop

Categories=Network;
Keywords=discord;vencord;electron;chat;
Comment=Vesktop is a custom Discord App aiming to give you better performance and improve linux support. Vencord comes pre-installed
MimeType=x-scheme-handler/discord
```

>[!NOTE]
